| **Strategy**                      | **Description**                                                         | **Pros**                                      | **Cons**                                      |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Rolling Deployment**             | Gradual replacement of old version with the new one.                    | Minimal downtime, gradual transition.         | Potential instability during rollout.         |
| **Blue-Green Deployment**          | Two environments (Blue and Green), switch traffic after verification.   | Zero downtime, easy rollback.                | Requires double infrastructure.              |
| **Canary Deployment**              | Gradual rollout of a new version to a small subset of users.            | Low-risk rollout, performance testing.        | Slower rollout, limited exposure.            |
| **A/B Testing**                    | Traffic split between two versions for comparison.                      | Direct comparison, performance insights.      | Complex to implement, requires metrics.       |
| **Recreate Deployment**            | Stop old version, deploy new version from scratch.                      | Simple to implement.                         | Downtime during deployment.                  |
| **Shadow Deployment**              | Duplicate traffic sent to new version for testing without impact.       | No user impact, live testing.                | Not truly testing user experience.           |
| **Feature Toggles**                | Deploy features behind flags and toggle on/off.                         | Instant rollback, test in production.        | Complexity in managing flags.                |
| **Dark Launch**                    | New features deployed silently without user interaction.                | No user impact, smooth rollout.              | Difficult to measure success.                |
| **Rolling Update with Pause**      | Rolling update with manual verification at each step.                   | Manual verification, controlled rollout.     | Slower deployment.                           |
| **Canary with Progressive Rollout**| Gradual traffic increase, based on monitoring.                          | Continuous monitoring, controlled rollout.   | Requires robust monitoring.                 |
