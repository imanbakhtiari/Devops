## MXE (M cross environment) is an open-source, cross-compilation environment that allows you to build software for Windows on non-Windows platforms like Linux and macOS. It simplifies the process of cross-compiling by providing a wide array of libraries and tools typically used in C++ development, such as Qt, Boost, SDL, etc.

#### Although primarily aimed at creating Windows binaries on Linux/macOS, it can also be extended to build binaries for other platforms like Linux and macOS themselves by using custom toolchains.

### MXE Key Features:
- Provides cross-compilation toolchains.
- Offers pre-built libraries for easy integration.
- Supports a wide range of platforms, though the primary focus is Windows.
- Ideal for developers looking to create cross-platform binaries from a single system (especially Linux).
